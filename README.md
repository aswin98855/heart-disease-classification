**conda install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn**


## Let's see a outlook of this project :


**This project looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.**

## We're going to take the following approach :

1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

## We're going to try 3 different machine learning models:

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
